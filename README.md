# Poincare Disk

This model demonstrates a tree embedded
in the Poincare disk, and allows an observer to 
move around in the model to see what hyperbolic
motion is like. Use the up and down keys to move
forward and backward; use the left and right
arrow keys to rotate.

The movement is implemented through
mobius transforms, and the tiling is implemented
through an ad-hoc implementation of the coxeter group
generating the (3 inf) tiling of the hyperbolic plane.

More explanations in comments in the source code.
